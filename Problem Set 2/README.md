### Problem 1 (2.1)
Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month.

### Problem 2 (2.2)
Now write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months. By a fixed monthly payment, we mean a single number which does not change each month, but instead is a constant amount that will be paid each month. Assume that the interest is compounded monthly according to the balance at the end of the month (after the payment for that month is made). The monthly payment must be a multiple of $10 and is the same for all months.

### Problem 3 (2.3)
Write a program that uses bounded monthly payments and bisection search to find the smallest monthly payment to the cent (no more multiples of $10) such that we can pay off the debt within a year. Try it out with large inputs, and notice how fast it is (try the same large inputs in your solution to Problem 2 to compare!). Produce the same return value as you did in Problem 2.
